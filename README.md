In this repository, we provide the measurements of the light pollution conducted in Salerno (Italy) and province thanks to the support of Unione Astrofili Italiani.
The first measurements were performed on the 19th December 2022.

The instrument used for the measurements is the Sky Quality Meter produced by Unihedron (http://www.unihedron.com/projects/darksky/).
