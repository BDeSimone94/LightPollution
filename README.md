In this repository, we provide the measurements of the light pollution conducted in Salerno (Italy) and province thanks to the support of Unione Astrofili Italiani.
The first measurements were performed on the 19th December 2022.

The instrument used for the measurements is the Sky Quality Meter produced by Unihedron (http://www.unihedron.com/projects/darksky/).

*********************************
Half Width Half Maximum (HWHM) for the angular sensitivity: 42°
Required: 9V battery
Dimensions: 9.6 x 6.1 x 2.5
Maximum sampling duration: 80 seconds

LEGEND OF COLUMNS

Date(dd/mm/yyy): the date of the observation

Start-time(hh:mm,IT): the starting time of the observation (measurements last ~seconds)

Location: the location of the measurement

Latitude(N°,',"): the latitude of the location in °,'," North (obtained with GPS system in personal smartphone)

Longitude(E°,',"): the longitude of the location in °,'," North (obtained with GPS system in personal smartphone)

Temperature(°C): the temperature of the location at the measurement time	(Celsius degrees)

Weather: the weather condition	

Series-no.: the number of the measurement series. 3 series of 4 measurements (one for each cardinal points)	are performed in each site

Measurements(x4,mag/arcs^2,visible): the 4 values of the night sky brightness measurements obtained with the SQM (mag/arcsec^2,visible bands+IR-cut) 

Error: the standard deviation of the 4 measurement series	(the nominal error for each measurement is +/- 0.1 mag/arcsec^2)

Mean:	the mean of the 4 measurement series	

Mean(4x3): the mean of the 3x4 series of measurements	

Error(4x3): the error of the 3x4 series of measurements (quadrature)
